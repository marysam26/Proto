## Current Status

The project has a front end that is mostly finished. There are still some features and models/controllers that need implemented. Some tweaking to align with design mockups needs to be done as well.

The project is ready for database implementation in order to utilize the functionality of the front end. Once the database is connected, phase 1 of testing begins where we are looking for major flaws in design & programming.
